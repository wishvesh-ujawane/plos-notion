# 🏠 Home Dashboard — full spec

The top-level page users land on. Zero new databases — only **linked-database views** of the DBs built in areas 01–04. Build this **last**, after every area's DBs and views exist.

Icon: 🏠. Parent: **PLOS — Second Brain** (sits directly under the parent, above the four area pages in the sidebar).

---

## Page structure

Top-to-bottom layout (each `##` is a Notion heading_2 block; each linked view is one linked_database block underneath):

```
🏠 PLOS — Home
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Callout: "One page. Today, this week, and what matters. Everything else lives in the area pages."

## Linked view specs

Each row describes one linked_database block. `Source` = which underlying DB the view reads from. `Filter/Sort/Group` are the settings applied to that specific linked view (they don't affect the source DB's own views). Layout defaults to `table` unless stated.

### 🎯 Today

| Name | Source | Filter | Sort | Group | Layout |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Today — Tasks (union) | Personal Tasks | `Today` = ✓ OR `Due` = today | `Priority Score` desc | `Area` | table |
| Today — Time Blocks | Time Blocks | `Date` = today | `Start Time` asc | `Kind` | table |
| Today — Habits to log | Habits | `Active` = ✓ | `Ritual` asc | `Ritual` | table |

> **Note:** True "union across four task DBs" is not natively supported by a single linked view. Recommended pattern: consolidate day-of tasks in **Personal Tasks** with `Area` set to Trading/Salesforce/Cloud101/Personal so a single view can show them all. Area-specific task DBs stay for planning; day-of pull is one place.
> Alternative: create three separate linked views (Trading Tasks / Career Tasks / Business Tasks / Personal Tasks) and stack them under the same heading.

### 🗓️ This week

| Name | Source | Filter | Sort | Group | Layout |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| This week — Career follow-ups | Career Pipeline | `Next Step Date` this week | `Next Step Date` asc | — | table |

## Fallback plan

If the MCP server can't create a `linked_database` block with all filters/sorts pre-applied (this happens; the Notion API's block-creation coverage for linked databases is thinner than for other block types), the home-PC agent should:

1. Create the plain page with all the headings and callouts.
2. Under each heading, insert a plain paragraph like `TODO: manually add a linked view of <DB> filtered by <criteria>`.
3. Report to the user which linked views could not be created programmatically so the user can add them manually via the Notion UI (`/ Linked view of database`, pick DB, apply filter/sort/group). This is a ~2-min manual step per view and only happens once.

---

## Home dashboard build order

1. Create the 🏠 Home page as a **child of `PLOS — Second Brain`**, sibling to the four area pages.
2. Insert the intro callout.
3. For each section (`##` heading), insert the heading, then attempt each linked view underneath.
4. If a linked view creation fails, insert the TODO fallback paragraph and continue — do not abort the whole build.
5. After the whole page is built, report a summary of `<count>` linked views created / `<count>` fallback TODOs.
